# Satellite Rotator

It's a project in progress. This project is a rotator control program for amateur radio satellite communitation. It acts as a TCP server which receives command from Look4Sat, and translate them to Pelco-D protocol and send it to rotator by 485 serial port.

It's developed using Flutter, and hopefully it will work well across all platforms(Linux, Windows, MacOS) ^_^
